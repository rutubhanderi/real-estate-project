# Real Estate Platform

## Project Introduction
The real estate industry is increasingly adopting digital solutions to streamline property transactions. To meet this demand, we have developed a feature-rich real estate website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Our platform allows users to effortlessly list properties for sale or rent, explore available listings, and connect directly with property owners for inquiries and negotiations. The application aims to simplify the process of buying, selling, and renting properties by offering a seamless, user-friendly experience.
